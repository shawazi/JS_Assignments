2. Write a JS code to display Perfect Numbers from 1 to 1000.
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. (6 = 1 + 2 + 3)
Example - 1: input= 6 => output="6 is a prime number"

JS assignment:
4. Develop a guessing game. Randomly generate a number between 0-100. Ask the user to guess that number.
The user should have 5 chance to guess the number.
If the number entered by the user:
is greater than the random number then warn user to decrease,
is less than the random number then warn user to increase,
is equal to the random number then congratulate the user and tell in how many guesses were used to find the number
If user canâ€™t find the number in 5 guess then game is lost and display the random number.
Hint: you can use this code to generate random number 0-100
const winingNumber = Math.round(Math.random() * 100);
