# JS_Assignments

Hi, my apologies for using this file structure here, but I wanted to try to limit the number of individual repos in my account. I will keep pushing the teamwork or regular homework assignments to individual repos, but for the Slack assignments, I want to try this nested file structure. Let me know if you need these assignments separated into individual repos instead. Thanks!
