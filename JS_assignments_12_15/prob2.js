// GCD of two integers

let input1 = +prompt("Please enter the first number: ");
let input2 = +prompt("Please enter the second number: ");

// not sure how to do this mathematically. i found a formula, i will try that tomorrow. GCD formula, but it also uses the least common multiple as an argument in the formula, so i'll need to also calculate the least common multuple.
