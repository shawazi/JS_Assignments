JS assignment:
1. Write a JavaScript program to display the difference between a given number and 20, if the number is greater than 20 display double the absolute difference
Example1: num = 3; output => 20 - 3 = 17
Example2: num = 30; output => (30 - 20) * 2 = 20 (edited) 


JS assignment:
2. Write a JavaScript program that takes 3 integers from a user and displays the largest
Example: num1 = 3, num2 = 4, num3 = 5; output => "num3 is the largest"


JS assignment:
3. Write a JavaScript program that takes 3 integers from a user, multiplies all these numbers, and displays the sign of the product.
Example-1: num1 = 3, num2 = 4, num3 = 5; output => solution:"3*4*5=60" sign"+"
Example-2: num1 = 5, num2 = -6, num3 = 2; output => solution:"5*-6*2=-60" sign"-"


JS assignment:
4. Write a JavaScript program to check whether a given integer is in the range 50 to 100.
Example1: num = 25; output => "25 is not in the range of 50 to 100"
Example2: num = 75; output => "75 is in the range of 50 to 100"


JS assignment:
5. Write a JavaScript program to find a value that is nearest to 100 from two different given integer
Example: num-1 = -25, num-2=275 ; output => "num-1 is closer to the 100"


JS assignment:
6. Write a JavaScript program that asks the user to enter a day, check this day, and display whether a weekday or not.
Example-1: day = "Wednesday"; output => "Wednesday is a weekday"
Example-2: day = "Saturday"; output => "Saturday is not a weekday"

JS assignment:
7. Write a basic Calculator with JavaScript. Ask the user to enter 2 numbers and an operand (+,-,*,/). Execute the desired operation and display the result.
Example1: num1 = 3, num2 = 4, operand = *; output => 3 * 4 = 12
Example2: num1 = 8, num2 = 2, operand = /; output => 8 / 2 = 4
Example3: num1 = 32, num2 = 14, operand = -; output => 32 - 14 = 18
Example4: num1 = 18, num2 = 41, operand = +; output => 18 + 41 = 59
